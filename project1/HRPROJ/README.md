2016 MLB Homerun Derby:

How to play:

1. First, scroll down to choose a batter.

2. once batter is selected, the pitcher is ready to go. In 
   the scroll down menu select one of the three pitch options.
   fastball, curveball, or changeup.

3. To execute the User guess select the "swing!" button.

4. Once the swing button is used the User will recieve a message alerting
   the batter that he/she has either struck out. Or guessed the same pitch 
   which would equate to a homerun.

5. Continue this process over and over again until the user has recieved 5 outs.

6. Once 5 outs has been reached switch with another user and see who can hit
   the most homeruns before the out limit is reached!
