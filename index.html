  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Stu Porter. A recent graduate of the Leeds Schoold of Business, I enter the world with a myriad of passions. These passions, inspired by past projects, school, and hobbies include sports, music, technology, and the health industry. As someone who is constantly filled with ideas, I feel like I could further continue my dreams and ambitions by adding the coding skill set to help my entreprenurial endeavors. I feel that my financial background will help me tremendously with any business I may potentially start, but I will not be able to fully build it without the Immersive Web Development skill set!</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Born in Chicago and raised in Boston, my entrepreneurial spirit emerged early on at Wellesley High School. With the help of my business professor, Jess Hatch, myself and 3 colleagues were able to become the original founders of the Wellesley School Store. By Junior year I decided to combine my passion for business and music and started 1881 Records. With the talented musician and close friend, Cam Meekins, I managed his career and distribution until he was signed my senior year of high school to well-known Atlantic Records. This was my first taste of business success and I was able to profit financially and internally by seeing a friend accomplish his dreams of signing to a major label. After graduating from WHS and wrapping up 1881, I attended the Leeds School of Business where I would major in Finance. In the summers of 2012-2014 I worked for Denham Capital Management, a private equity focused on Oil and Natural Gas, Metal and Mining, and Power. Through the internship I was able to learn about all three industries in the Boston, Houston, and London offices. Throughout my tenure at Leeds I would complete a number of meaningful projects that have helped me learn what it takes to start a business. In Operations and Management (OPIM) where my team developed a business based on the semesters theme of hospitals. We created, Vail Valley Medical Center a specialized hospital focusing on mountain-related injuries and rehabilitation. In Capital Investment Analysis I co-wrote a 140-page analysis on American Telephone and Telegraph. The paper consisted of quantitative financial models, and a qualitative look at the company, industry, and competitors. In my final summer in Boulder, I was accepted into the Business of Sports program. Through the program I worked for Vail Resorts, where I would complete one my greatest accomplishments to date. My 3 classmates and I came up with a 200-page answer to Vail Resorts question, How can we raise revenue and occupancy rates in the Summer seasons for Vail Resorts Colorado properties? During the project I personally came up with a plan to have a music festival similar to Coachella and Lollapalooza, and hold it close to one of the Vail Resorts properties. Vail Resorts liked this idea so much that they plan to employ my idea and hold their first music festival in the summer of 2017.</p>
