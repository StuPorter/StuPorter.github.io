2016 MLB Homerun Derby:

How to play:

1. First, scroll down to choose a batter.

2. once batter is selected, the pitcher is ready to go. In 
   the scroll down menu select one of the three pitch options.
   fastball, curveball, or changeup.

3. To execute the User guess select the "swing!" button.

4. Once the swing button is used the User will recieve a message alerting
   the batter that he/she has either struck out. Or guessed the same pitch 
   which would equate to a homerun.

5. Continue this process over and over again until the user has recieved 5 outs.

6. Once 5 outs has been reached switch with another user and see who can hit
   the most homeruns before the out limit is reached!



Approaches Taken:

1.Throughout the project I used a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery to construct the homerun
derby game. The first step was to start structurally with a wireframe where I had a style of:

Wireframe:

col-12
col-12
col-6 col-3 col-3
col-12
col-6 col-6

2. Then I wrote functions that would check if the pitcher would 

3. I used Css for styling all my ID's and classes

4. I usdd Jquery to append objects and manipulate the DOM

Problems:

The only "problem" I really had was not being able to use Jquery animation to make a moving baseball go across the screen and either stay on one side of the screen or go from one side to the other implicating a homerun.
